Hello, my name is Anna Oh.


**ASSUMPTIONS & RESOURCES**
Online resources and third party sources:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164
https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223183008-Formatting-International-Phone-Numbers

According to these resources, E.164 formatting appeared to be add a "+1" in front of
any US phone number and remove any parentheses or dashes.

Example Input: (415)555-2671
Example Output: +14155552671


I assumed that:
- All phone numbers entered and returned are United States phone numbers.
  - Code can be improved to check the area code before conversion into a normalzied US phone number
- All phone numbers entered were valid phone numbers as long as they were 10 digits long.


**WHY JAVASCRIPT?**
As Josh DeShong Real Estate is looking for a Frontend Software Engineer with experience in Node.js, I used JavaScript for this coding challenge.
Also, JavaScript is the language of HTML and web browsing, and I assume that this position is more heavily focused with joshdeshong.com.
